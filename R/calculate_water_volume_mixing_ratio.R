#' Function to calculate the mixing ratio of water.
#' 
#' \code{calculate_water_volume_mixing_ratio} uses the August-Roche-Magnus 
#' equation to calculate the partial pressure of air and this is divided by
#' air pressure to calculate the mixing ratio of water in dry air.  
#' 
#' @param temp Temperature in degrees Celsius -- usually air temperature.
#' 
#' @param rh Relative humidity in percent. 
#' 
#' @param pressure Pressure (usually air pressure) in the units of 
#' hectopascal/millibar.
#' 
#' @param as_percent Should the units used for the return be percentage rather 
#' than a ratio? 
#' 
#' @return Numeric vector with the units of a ratio or percentage if 
#' \code{as_percent} is \code{TRUE}.
