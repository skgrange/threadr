#' Function to generate a sequence of past or future dates. 
#' 
#' \code{date_sequence} is useful for generating patterns which match file names.
#' 
#' @param days Number of days of the sequence from system's date. Use negative
#' integers to go back in time. 
#'
#' @param character Should the date sequence be returned as a character vector 
#' rather than a date vector? Default is \code{TRUE}. 
#'
#' @param today Should system date be included in the returned sequence? 
#'
#' @param sep What separator should be used between the year, month, and day
#' pieces of the date? If this is changed from \code{"-"} (hyphen), then the 
#' returned vector will always be a character.
